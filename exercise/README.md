# Year of Exercise

## February

### 2/1
**T25 - [Ab Intervals](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728258341)** 

**[Cindy](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728259014) - 8 Rounds Completed**

* 20 min AMRAP
* 5 Pullups
* 10 Pushups
* 15 Squats

**Notes:**
T25 made the abs pretty sore, but that's a standard sore that I've felt before.

_*PR'ed Cindy.*_ (1st time doing it so expected) She felt good; completed 8 reps. Tomorrow and the next day I will be muscle-sore, but it was a really good sweat. Heart rate may have been a little too high at the end, and the last set was definitely sloppy.

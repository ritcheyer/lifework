**Notes:**
Lost GPS towards the end of the run, so Strava's is inaccurate. I was able to edit Runkeeper's map to be more accurate. Copying data from my m400 (which didn't lose GPS).

I was able to complete 3 rounds of today's WOD. I had 1m30s left on the timer, but was toasted; couldn't push any more. Maybe I cheated myself, not sure.. Either way, successful workout.

**Notes:**
Definitely the hardest workout I've done so far. I was incredibly hesitant to start because I didn't want to actually do the work, but now that I did it I'm so thankful that I did.

Muscle wise I think I'm going to hurt pretty much everywhere tomorrow.

_EMOM 3 rounds of_:

```
Goblet squat
Mountain climber
Single-arm dumbbell swing
T-pushup
Split Jump
Dumbbell row
Dumbbell side lunge and touch
Pushup-position row
Dumbbell lunge and rotation

So far, I've completed this WOD 3x, with each time getting longer in duration or more sets. This was the first time I completed every exercise as prescribed (scaled given my ... abilities) as well as the number of sets asked.

Next time, I'm going to record how many of each I completed so I can track my progress better.

### 2/1
**T25 - [Ab Intervals](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728258341)** 

**[Cindy](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728259014) - 20 min AMRAP; completed 8 rounds of**

* 5 Pullups (assisted with bands)
* 10 Pushups (from knees)
* 15 Squats

**Notes:**
T25 made the abs pretty sore, but that's a standard sore that I've felt before.

_*PR'ed Cindy.*_ (1st time doing it so expected) She felt good; completed 8 reps. Tomorrow and the next day I will be muscle-sore, but it was a really good sweat. Heart rate may have been a little too high at the end, and the last set was definitely sloppy.

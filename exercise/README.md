## March

### 3/20

Warmup:

```
7 minute AMRAP of:
 - barbell thrusters (light weight, working on technique)
 - ring rows
 - burpees over box
```

Technique:
```
10 minutes of back squat technique, incrementally getting heavier. Finished @ 145lbs
```

WOD:
```
5 rounds of:
 - 7 thrusters @ 45 lbs (again, just working on technique)
 - 7 ring rows
 - 7 burpees
```

This WOD was challenging because thrusters are the "highest output movement" in CrossFit. That paired up with burpees which is the "furthest travel of the human body" in CrossFit made for a killer workout. Ring rows were there for resting, but still worked my Scaps really well.

### 3/8

**Warmup:**

```
3 rounds of:
 - 50m sled push (no weight)
 - 5 Standing kettlebell rows (35lbs)

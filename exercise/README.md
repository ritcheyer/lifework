# 2017 WODs

## October

### 10/4

**For time (15 min cap):**

```
100 Wall balls
Every Time you Rest, Run 200m
```

**For time (15 min cap):**
```
30-25-20-15-10-5
Dubz (3:1 SUs)
Russian KB Swing
```

**NOTES:**
* **Set 1:** Used a `20lb` wall ball, and finished in `14:50`.
  * This is a PR in that I used a heavier ball than the last time we did this on [7/10](https://github.com/ritcheyer/lifework/tree/master/exercise#710), when I used a `14lb` wall ball and finished in `13:57`.
  * Rowed `200m` instead of running 200m as I am nursing a calf muscle sprain/strain.
  * Sets were `20` / `13` / `12` / `15` / `15` / `10` / `8` / `7`
* **Set 2:** Finished with 20s to spare.
  * Instead of double unders (or `3:1` SUs, I biked `10 calories` for the same reason I did not run).

### 9/20

**30 Minute EMOM of:**

**NOTES:** used first round to set a goal: 15 calorie row + 15 wall balls. Calorie row was easy to achieve (consistently finished the set with 10-15s to spare). Wall balls were harder. I'm a little beat up still (sore back + right hip joint weirdness), so I maintained 15 reps for 5 rounds then dipped to 12 for 2, 10 for 2, then 9 for the last. Comparing results to [6/7](https://github.com/ritcheyer/lifework/tree/master/exercise#67), I maintained, but did not gain (at least, according to the notes) anything on my previous time.

```

**NOTE:** My plan was to go heavy on the kettle bells and small on the height of the box, but coach said the other way would be better for me. Get a strong posterior chain by lighter weights, bigger box. This exposed a weakness in that I am very uncomfortable stepping up that high with weights using my left leg. 

### 7/7

**Rules:**
1. break up into even teams
2. grab the lightest wallball (6lbs in our case)

4. Once the ball goes over the wall, the thrower does a burpee
5. If ball touches ground, receiving team does 3 burpees

## March

### 3/20

Warmup:

```
7 minute AMRAP of:
- barbell thrusters (light weight, working on technique)
- ring rows
- burpees over box
```

Technique:
```
10 minutes of back squat technique, incrementally getting heavier. Finished @ 145lbs
```

WOD:
```
5 rounds of:
- 7 thrusters @ 45 lbs (again, just working on technique)
- 7 ring rows
- 7 burpees
```

This WOD was challenging because thrusters are the "highest output movement" in CrossFit. That paired up with burpees which is the "furthest travel of the human body" in CrossFit made for a killer workout. Ring rows were there for resting, but still worked my Scaps really well.

### 3/8

**Warmup:**

- 50m sled push (no weight)
- 5 Standing kettlebell rows (35lbs)

Lost GPS towards the end of the run, so Strava's is inaccurate. I was able to edit Runkeeper's map to be more accurate. Copying data from my m400 (which didn't lose GPS).

I was able to complete 3 rounds of today's WOD. I had 1m30s left on the timer, but was toasted; couldn't push any more. Maybe I cheated myself, not sure.. Either way, successful workout.

**T25 - [Ab Intervals](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728258341)**

* 5 Pullups (assisted with bands)
* 10 Pushups (from knees)
* 15 Squats

**Notes:**
T25 made the abs pretty sore, but that's a standard sore that I've felt before.

_*PR'ed Cindy.*_ (1st time doing it so expected) She felt good; completed 8 reps. Tomorrow and the next day I will be muscle-sore, but it was a really good sweat. Heart rate may have been a little too high at the end, and the last set was definitely sloppy.

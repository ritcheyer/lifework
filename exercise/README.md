# 2018 WODs

## February

### 2/14

**5 Rounds of "Double Tabata"** (40s on / 20s. off):

```
Calorie Row, or Bike
Dumbbell Box Step-Up
Abmat Sit-Up
Russian KB Swing
Rest
```

**NOTES:** no real notes here. just a burner of a WOD. Get it done.

**After Party:** tried my hand at PRing another of the "Crossfit 5". I did a 150lb Strict Press. Rang dat bell.

### 2/9

“Fight Gone Bad”

3 Rounds, 1 minute each station:
WallBall
KB Swing
Box Jump
DB Push Press
Calorie Row, or Bike
*Rest

**NOTES:** 220 reps; not a PR, but square in the middle of my [PR of 242](https://github.com/ritcheyer/lifework/tree/master/exercise/2017.md#1227) and my previous [PR of 203](https://github.com/ritcheyer/lifework/tree/master/exercise/2017.md#43). I did find a really great approach after doing this one though. Rather than trying to burn through each round, pick a number of reps for each station - say 15 reps. Don't burn through your easiest round, but pace yourself well. example: `15reps x 5 movements x 3 rounds = 225 reps`. Next time you attempt FGB, do 16 reps per movement. Then 17. etc. 

### 2/7

# Year of Exercise

## February

### 2/13
**The Hairy Carpet.**

_3 rounds for time_:

```
20 overhead lunges (used 20lb medicine ball)
20 weighted sit ups (scaled to bodyweight only)
20 Burpees
100 jump ropes
20 push-ups
20 box jumps (scaled to step ups)
```

* **Round 1:** `12:30.37`
* **Round 2:** `16:04.47`
* **Round 3:** `17:21.82`

**Total time:** `45:57.35`

**Notes:**
Definitely the hardest workout I've done so far. I was incredibly hesitant to start because I didn't want to actually do the work, but now that I did it I'm so thankful that I did.

Muscle wise I think I'm going to hurt pretty much everywhere tomorrow.



### 2/8

### 2/7
**Spartacus WOD.**

_EMOM 3 rounds of_:

```
Goblet squat
Mountain climber
Single-arm dumbbell swing
T-pushup
Split Jump
Dumbbell row
Dumbbell side lunge and touch
Pushup-position row
Dumbbell lunge and rotation
Dumbbell push press
```

**Notes:**

* `60 sec` for each set.
* `20 sec` between each set.
* `120 sec` break between each round

**Total Time:** `40 min`

So far, I've completed this WOD 3x, with each time getting longer in duration or more sets. This was the first time I completed every exercise as prescribed (scaled given my ... abilities) as well as the number of sets asked.

Next time, I'm going to record how many of each I completed so I can track my progress better.

### 2/2
**Jogging.** 2.04 Miles in 23:52. [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728768358) & [Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/484740946)

### 2/1
**T25 - [Ab Intervals](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728258341)** 

**[Cindy](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728259014) - 20 min AMRAP; completed 8 rounds of**

* 5 Pullups (assisted with bands)
* 10 Pushups (from knees)
* 15 Squats

**Notes:**
T25 made the abs pretty sore, but that's a standard sore that I've felt before.

_*PR'ed Cindy.*_ (1st time doing it so expected) She felt good; completed 8 reps. Tomorrow and the next day I will be muscle-sore, but it was a really good sweat. Heart rate may have been a little too high at the end, and the last set was definitely sloppy.

**Notes:**
Lost GPS towards the end of the run, so Strava's is inaccurate. I was able to edit Runkeeper's map to be more accurate. Copying data from my m400 (which didn't lose GPS).

I was able to complete 3 rounds of today's WOD. I had 1m30s left on the timer, but was toasted; couldn't push any more. Maybe I cheated myself, not sure.. Either way, successful workout.

**Notes:**
Definitely the hardest workout I've done so far. I was incredibly hesitant to start because I didn't want to actually do the work, but now that I did it I'm so thankful that I did.

Muscle wise I think I'm going to hurt pretty much everywhere tomorrow.

So far, I've completed this WOD 3x, with each time getting longer in duration or more sets. This was the first time I completed every exercise as prescribed (scaled given my ... abilities) as well as the number of sets asked.

Next time, I'm going to record how many of each I completed so I can track my progress better.

### 2/2
**Jogging.** 2.04 Miles in 23:52. [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728768358) & [Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/484740946)

### 2/1
**T25 - [Ab Intervals](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728258341)** 

**[Cindy](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728259014) - 20 min AMRAP; completed 8 rounds of**

* 5 Pullups (assisted with bands)
* 10 Pushups (from knees)
* 15 Squats

**Notes:**
T25 made the abs pretty sore, but that's a standard sore that I've felt before.

_*PR'ed Cindy.*_ (1st time doing it so expected) She felt good; completed 8 reps. Tomorrow and the next day I will be muscle-sore, but it was a really good sweat. Heart rate may have been a little too high at the end, and the last set was definitely sloppy.

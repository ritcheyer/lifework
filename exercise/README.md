### 2/7
**Spartacus WOD.**

_3 rounds of_:

1. Goblet squat
2. Mountain climber
3. Single-arm dumbbell swing
4. T-pushup
5. Split Jump
6. Dumbbell row
7. Dumbbell side lunge and touch
8. Pushup-position row

10. Dumbbell push press

**Notes:**

* `60 sec` for each set.
* `20 sec` between each set.
* `120 sec` break between each round
* **`40 min`** total Time

So far, I've completed this WOD 3x, with each time getting longer in duration or more sets. This was the first time I completed every exercise as prescribed (scaled given my ... abilities) as well as the number of sets asked.

Next time, I'm going to record how many of each I completed so I can track my progress better.

### 2/2
**Jogging.** 2.04 Miles in 23:52. [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728768358) & [Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/484740946)

### 2/1
**T25 - [Ab Intervals](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728258341)** 

**[Cindy](https://runkeeper.com/user/ritcheyer/activity/728259014) - 20 min AMRAP; completed 8 rounds of**

* 5 Pullups (assisted with bands)
* 10 Pushups (from knees)
* 15 Squats

**Notes:**
T25 made the abs pretty sore, but that's a standard sore that I've felt before.

_*PR'ed Cindy.*_ (1st time doing it so expected) She felt good; completed 8 reps. Tomorrow and the next day I will be muscle-sore, but it was a really good sweat. Heart rate may have been a little too high at the end, and the last set was definitely sloppy.

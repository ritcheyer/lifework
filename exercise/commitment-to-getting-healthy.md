**[2017-05-19 Update]**
Since starting on this commitment to getting healthy, several things have changed in my life:
 - Sammy is starting to sleep through the night more frequently
 - Moved to Lincoln, CA
 - More discipline required during the workday given sports and other such things in the evenings

Items on the above list I believe to have tackled and been successful on are:
 - [x] Excercising 3x/wk

Items I am in process of working out are:
 - [x] Waking up at 7am on the days I exercise. Working on the other days still.

Items I am still struggling with:
 - [ ] Late night snacking
 - [ ] Portion control
 - [ ] Bed time habits

I'm seeing progress in each of these areas, but still need to pursue them.

Below is a note I sent to the guys in our #humblebragging channel in Slack. Fueled by a determination to get healthy. Outlined below are my top 5 struggles (as of 2016-09-12) and what I'll be doing to resolve them.

Alright dudes... today I renew my commitment to this channel and my goal. My weight has gone in the wrong direction for the last few weeks, and after having been so close to my goal weight then fallen so far back (yes, small number in the grand scheme of things), I’m unhappy with myself. I put myself in front of you guys and ask for your help..

### My struggles are as follows:

 - Portion control
 - Late night snacking
 - Poor habits around exercising (“it’s ok to miss… no big deal; just do another one tomorrow”)
 - Bed time habits
 - Waking up habits

While I know that each and every one of these can be easier for other people to be lax about, I cannot (at least, not yet). I’m being honest here because you guys are great and inspiring.

### My goals to fix the above are as follows:

 - *Bedtime:* In bed with lights off and phone put away by midnight. Regardless of workload. There will always be more.
 - *Awake time:* Out of bed no later than 7am. I'm starting here, but have a true goal of 6am.
 - *Exercise:* Exercising at least 3x/week. Ideally, this would be MWF in the mornings, but likely at lunch or at night (given my station in life and the above 2 goals)... if morning or lunch time don't work for whatever reason, then it must be complete before bedtime. This would mean after the kids go to bed.
 - *Late night snacking:* The idea here would be to curb most snacking by eating something like carrots and/or a small handful of cashews if I'm truly hungry, or gum if I simply want to chew on something.
 - *Portion control:* starting with a smaller plate.

All of you guys are busy with your own life/exercise goals, so I don't expect anything from you, but if you feel so inclined to challenge me in any way, I will answer honestly and forthrightly. If I'm slacking, call me out. I will be 100% honest.

Onward.

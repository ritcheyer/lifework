49 push-ups
49 sit-ups
49 squats
```

## Intermediate

```
Run 800 meters
35 push-ups
35 sit-ups

```

>  Complete each run under 4 minutes or decrease the distance. The reps are reduced to keep intensity high. During the push-ups the shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle should move as one unit. Squeezing the glutes and stomach can assist with this alignment. Have a friend assist or video yourself in warm-up to see if you can maintain a rigid position between the ankle, knee, hip and shoulder. Press to full extension of the arms at the top. Use a support such as an abmat for the lumbar spine to execute the sit-ups. The shoulder blades should touch the ground at the bottom and the shoulders should come past the hip crease at the top. Squat below parallel and stand up to full hip and knee extension to ensure full range of motion while moving quickly. If the athlete can complete 20 unbroken push-ups and run 400m in less than 1:30 they should be encouraged to attempt this workout as written.

## Beginner

```
Run 600 meters
24 elevated push-ups
24 sit-ups
24 squats
```
>  Complete each run under 4 minutes or decrease the distance. See the video for set-up of the elevated push-up. Find a box height that allows you to execute at least 5 consecutive push-ups throughout the workout. During the sit-ups, the shoulder blades should touch the ground at the bottom and the shoulders should come past the hip crease at the top. Squat below parallel and stand up to full hip and knee extension to ensure full range of motion. If necessary, place a target behind the body to help gauge depth.
